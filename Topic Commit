My topic is on GMO labeling. There has been legislation passes, but no standards set yet. The purpose of my white paper will be to convince the audience that just beause it says GMO free or it contains GMOs that it is dangerous. They should read those labels with a grain of salt. My audience will be people who are interested in leanring more about the labeling of GM products.
